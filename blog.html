            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
            <p>On September 11, 2001, eighteen men boarded airplanes with the intent of crashing them
into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the White House or Capitol. They succeeded with three of the planes, causing enormous destruction. The fourth plane crashed,but thanks to passengers who discovered the highjackers’ plans and attacked the highjackers, the destruction of the White</p> <p>House or Capitol was prevented. What forces drove thehighjackers to undertake such action? What forces led the passengers to organize togetherto thwart them? What might have prevented the highjackings? Such questions fall under the
purview of social science—the scientific study of social, cultural, psychological, economic,
and political forces that guide individuals in their actions.</p><p>
Formal social science is relatively new. Nevertheless, a vast amount of information has
been accumulated concerning the social life of human beings. This information has been
used in building a system of knowledge about the nature, growth, and functioning of
human societies. Social science is the name given to that system of knowledge.</p><p>
All knowledge is (1) knowledge of human beings, including their culture and products,
and (2) knowledge of natural environment. Human culture has been changing, and knowledge about it has been gradually accumulating ever since the far distant time when humans</p><p>
first assumed their distinctively human character. But until rather recent times, this knowledge was not scientific in the modern sense. Scientific knowledge is knowledge that has
been systematically gathered, classified, related, and interpreted. It is concerned with learning the concepts and applying those concepts to particulars, rather than just learning a vast
amount of information.</p><p>
Primitive peoples acquired much of their knowledge unconsciously, just as we today
still begin the use of our native language and acquire many of the basic elements in our culture unconsciously. For the most part, they accepted the world as they found it, and if any</p>
